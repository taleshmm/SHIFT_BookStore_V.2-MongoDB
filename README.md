# Python Bookstore Project (Version 1.0)

Welcome to the Python Bookstore Project! This is an initial project of a bookstore application developed using object-oriented principles, conditional structures, loops, functions, and lists. In this initial version, the application will operate in memory, without data persistence in a database.

## Main Features

1. **Add Book:** Allows you to add new books to the bookstore. Each book will have a title, author, publication year, and other relevant information.

2. **Search Book:** Enables you to search for books in the bookstore based on different attributes, such as title, author, publication year, etc.

3. **Delete Book:** Permits the removal of books from the bookstore based on a unique identifier.

4. **Search by Specific Attribute:** Allows searching for books based on a specific attribute, such as all books by a particular author.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository to your computer.

3. Open the terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project.

4. Execute the `main.py` file using the following command:

5. Follow the instructions in the terminal to interact with the application. Use the numeric options to select the desired action.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `dao/`: Contains files related to data access objects.
- `model/`: Contains class definitions representing project objects.
- `service/`: Contains the business logic of the application.
- `utils/`: Contains utility functions and shared resources.

## Next Steps

This is the first version of the Python Bookstore Project. In the next steps, I to go may consider the following improvements:

- Implement data persistence using a database, such as SQLite or MySQL.
- Create a more user-friendly interface, possibly with a GUI using a library like Tkinter.
- Implement API routes using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.
- Prepare the application for web deployment, considering services like Heroku or AWS.
